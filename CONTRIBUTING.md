# Contributing 

[**contactlab-magento-syscheck**](https://github.com/contactlab/contactlab-magento-syscheck) is open source software; we welcome, encourage and support contributions from the community.
Please take a moment to read these guidelines before submitting changes.

### Branching and pull requests

We adopt a [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model, and encourage a fork & pull approach to contribute to the codebase.
As a guideline, please follow this process:

 1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
 2. Create a topic branch for the change:
    - New features should branch from **develop**.
    - Bug fixes to existing versions should branch from **master**.
    - Please ensure the branch is clearly labelled as a feature or fix.
 3. Make the relevant changes.
 4. [Squash](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) commits if necessary.
 5. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to the **contactlab-magento-syscheck** project.

Please note this is a general guideline only. For more information on the
branching structure please see the [git-flow cheatsheet](http://danielkummer.github.com/git-flow-cheatsheet/).
